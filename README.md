# Java Swing Calculator

This Java Swing-based calculator is a comprehensive tool for performing basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also features advanced functionality such as power functions, square root operations, and the ability to input parentheses for prioritizing mathematical operations.

Key features include:

- **Comprehensive User Interface**: The calculator uses Java Swing to provide a graphical user interface, allowing users to visually input and perform mathematical calculations.
- **Robust Mathematical Operations**: Apart from basic arithmetic operations, the calculator is capable of handling power operations (both square and arbitrary powers), square root operations, and parentheses for complex equations.
- **Mouse Click Events**: Each button on the calculator has a mouse event listener. Clicking on the button triggers the respective operation or input.
- **Intelligent Button Input Handling**: The calculator intelligently handles button input to maintain the integrity of the equation being formed. For example, it ensures operators aren't inputted without preceding numbers, and parentheses are placed correctly.
- **Dynamic Display**: It features a dynamic label that displays the current equation and updates in real time as you input data. It also provides real-time feedback on the calculation result.
- **Negation Handling**: The calculator can handle negative numbers and allows the user to toggle the sign of an already inputted number.

This project is a great example of a graphical calculator built using Java Swing. It's useful for anyone learning Java GUI development or looking to integrate a calculator function into a larger Java Swing project.
